<h1>Kill La Kill</h1><br><br>
<p>Honnouji Academy is a fictional high school situated in Tokyo Bay, Japan on the island of Honn≈ç City. The school is dominated by its fearsome student council led by Satsuki Kiryuin. Its students wear Goku Uniforms which give their wearers superhuman abilities because they are constructed with a special material known as Life Fibers. Vagrant transfer student Ryuko Matoi, who wields a scissor-shaped longsword that can cut Goku Uniforms, challenges the council as she searches for her father's killer. Although she is initially easily defeated by Takaharu Fukuroda, she finds a sentient sailor uniform that she names Senketsu, a Kamui which is completely made of Life Fibers and transforms her so that she can face Kiryuin and her trials and obstacles. She is befriended by her hyperactive classmate Mako Mankanshoku and lives with her family.</p><br>
